Current Issues:

Todos 2D:
	1. Sprite blitting (with scaling and rotation)

Backlog 2D:
	1. Ellipses

Todos 3D:
	1. Model importing

Font File Format:
	- Need a python script to generate font files that are small as possible

	Files Need:
		- A mapping of character to glyph
		- A mapping of character width to glyph (not height, since that should be universal)
		- A bit-per-pixel bitmap of each character (this will keep file as small as possible)
