- Texture filtering/mip mapping?
- Point lighting/specular highlighting
- Directional lighting (shadow mapping)
- Z-buffering
- Better clipping?
- Transparency
- Vectorize (create a vector library and vectorize the drawTriangleShaded, fill, and other functions)
- Multiple frame buffering (threads rendering frames in a circular buffer)threads rendering frames in a circular buffer)
